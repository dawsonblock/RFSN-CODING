# Core runtime dependencies for the RFSN controller
#
# This file contains only the libraries required to run the core controller and
# sandbox offline. Optional model backends (e.g. OpenAI, Google GenAI) have
# been moved to requirements-llm.txt so environments without internet or
# heavy SDKs can still install and execute the controller safely.
